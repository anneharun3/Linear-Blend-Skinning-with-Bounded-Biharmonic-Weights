I have implemented Bounded Biharmonic Weights, Laplacian and Mass matrices and linear blend skinning Succesfully using Javascript
I have done this assignment in linux and used python3 -m http.server to run the local server.
I have removed init_bbw as it is constantly giving warnings and removing it didn't change the output.
The code is working perfectly except while loading handle presets woody five. It takes around 30-50 sec to load.

Thank u so much for the support professor.
